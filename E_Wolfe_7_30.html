<h2>Unit 7: Question 30:  Talking about javascript dates.</h2>
<p />
<hr />

<h3>a.</h3>
<b>What does new Date()produce?</b>
<p />
new Date() will give the following; 

<ul>
<li>day of the week</li>
<li>the current month</li>
<li>the current day of the month</li>
<li>the current four digit year</li>
<li>the current time in hh:mm:ss format</li>
<li>and then the Time Zone.</li>
</ul>

You can then assign it to a variable and work with the data.
<p />

<hr />
<h3>b.</h3>
<b>What does new Date(2009, 0, 20) produce?</b>
<p />
You get the same information as above but as applied to the date 01/20/2009.  A more interesting question comes from the fact Javascript is using "0" for January.<br />
What happens when you do new Date(2009, 0, 0)?<p />Then you have to ask why the inconsistency?

<p />
<hr />
<h3>c.</h3>
<b>If d1 and d2 refer to date objects, what does the expression d1.valueOf() - d2.ValueOf() produce?</b>
<p />
Javascript dates are actually the number of milliseconds that have expired since 01 January, 1970 00:00:00 Universal Time (UTC).<br />
One day contains 86,400,000 milliseconds, so we are dealing with large numbers.
<p />
Our expression will subtract the number of milliseconds contained in d2 from the number of milliseconds found in d1 and returm the difference.

<script>

var d1 = new Date();
var d2 = new Date(2009, 0, 20);

// alert(d1.valueOf());
// alert(d2.valueOf());

// alert(d1.valueOf() - d2.valueOf());

</script>
